## Abstract  
Agriculture plays a key role in global food security, intricately tied to water resources for crop growth. However, navigating the interplay between agriculture and water availability poses challenges, especially during the Anthropocene, where traditional perspectives often overlook agriculture’s impacts on the water cycle. Understanding and integrating agriculture’s influence on water dynamics becomes imperative in addressing contemporary challenges. Our study highlights the contrasting impacts of agricultural activities across temperate and snowy climates. In temperate catchments, agriculture weakens the precipitation-streamflow (P-Q) relationship, contributing to precipitation-driven deviations from the water–energy balance, while in snowy catchments, agricultural activities strengthen the P-Q relationship. These findings offer insights for shaping effective water management strategies, ensuring food security, and promoting sustainable development globally.
